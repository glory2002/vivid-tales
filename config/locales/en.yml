# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

While on her way, she meets a friend on whom she can always rely. She then understands that the drones are not always lazy and annoying but can be good friends too, as they entertain and cheer you up even when you are feeling incredibly sad. "

These pedagogical ideas are left behind by Master Beinsa Duno and are aimed at the improvement of the child's soul."
